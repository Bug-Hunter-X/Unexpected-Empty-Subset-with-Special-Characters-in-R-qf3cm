# Unexpected Empty Subset with Special Characters in R

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors containing special characters. When using the `%in%` operator for subsetting, characters like `%`, `&`, or others might cause unexpected behavior, potentially returning an empty data frame even if matching elements exist.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when trying to subset a data frame based on a character vector that includes special characters.  R's `%in%` operator might not interpret these special characters correctly, leading to a mismatch and an empty subset. This is not immediately obvious and can be tricky to debug.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.r` file contains a reproducible example showing this issue. It demonstrates how subsetting a data frame with a character vector containing a `%` character leads to an empty data frame.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.r` file presents a solution to this issue, showcasing a more robust method for subsetting that handles special characters correctly.  The solution involves using `fixed = TRUE` in `grepl` or regular expressions for accurate matching.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `bug.r` and run the R code. Observe the unexpected empty result.
3. Open `bugSolution.r` to see how to correct this behavior using safer methods.
